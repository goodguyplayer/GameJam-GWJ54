Flamey:
U-Ugh...
Where... Where am I?

Satin - Annoyed:
Don't tell me you already forgo-

Satin - Oh right:
Oh riiiiiight, River Lethe...

Satin - Happy:
Alright kiddo, I'll give you the short summary:
One - You are in hell. 

Flamey:
So that means you're-

Satin - Annoyed:
Satin

Flamey:
Wha

Satin - Annoyed:
You humans have used my name so much that I had to copyright it.

Satin - Anger:
Turns out SOMEONE ALREADY DID IT.

Satin - Annoyed:
So I'm Satin now
Can't have ---- in hell.

Flamey:
...

Satin - Annoyed:
ANYWAY

Satin - Happy:
Two - You struck a bargain with me for eternal life and didn't read the fine print.
Your soul is now mine

Flamey:
No... It can't be...

Satin - Meh:
Sucks to be you, asked for immortality but didn't care about the soul. 
Your body is still up there, living an eternal life.

Flamey:
Is there a way out?
I'll do anything to leave

Satin - Smirk:
That's what I like to hear

** Load player into arena **

Flamey:
Where am I?

Satin - Smirk:
Welcome to the show everyone!
Today - And for a long time - We have FLAMEY!

Flamey:
Wha-?

Satin - Annoyed:
First timers get to learn, sadly

Satin - Smirk:
Well, welcome to the arena Flamey!
You said you'd do anything to leave...
So you're our clown now!

Flamey:
...

Satin - Smirk:
First off, you'll be fighting demons!
Don't worry, you can burn them at close or long range. Just check your settings for your buttons!

Flamey:
?

Satin - Smirk:
Oh but you can't just burn them!
You have to curse them. Give them a curse and they can be killed.
Lucky you, you have a million of curses within your soul.
Share the love, shoot them with curses and then attack!

Satin - Oh whoops:
Oh, I almost forgot

Satin - Smirk:
Floor breaks. And fixes itself. Don't fall down.

Flamey:
What happens if I fall?

Satin - Smirk:
Well, that's when the show starts again!
From the beginning, with all of your curses.
You only get to leave when you have no curses left. Got it?

Satin - Joy:
Let the show begin!
